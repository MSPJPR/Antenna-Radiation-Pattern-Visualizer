Key Features

1. Antenna Type Selection:

Supports common antenna types such as Dipole, Patch, Yagi-Uda, Helical, Parabolic Reflector, and Horn.

Dynamically adjusts the radiation pattern based on the selected antenna.



2. Parameter Customization:

Users can input parameters like frequency (MHz), gain (dBi), and scaling factors to observe real-time changes in the pattern.



3. Color Customization:

A built-in color picker allows users to choose the graph's color for better visualization.



4. Overlay Mode:

Enables users to overlay multiple patterns for comparison without clearing the canvas.



5. Graph Labels:

Includes labeled axes and legends for clear understanding of the radiation patterns.



6. Export as Image:

Users can download the generated graph as a PNG image for offline use.



7. Dynamic User Interface:

A vibrant gradient background and responsive design ensure a visually engaging and user-friendly interface.

Technologies Used

1. Frontend:

HTML: Structure of the application.

CSS: Styling, including animations and responsive design.

JavaScript: Core functionality for dynamic visualization and interactivity.



2. Canvas API:

Used to render the antenna radiation patterns graphically.



3. Responsive Design:

Ensures usability across devices with varying screen sizes.

How It Works

1. The user selects an antenna type from a dropdown menu.


2. Input fields allow customization of antenna parameters (e.g., frequency, gain, scaling).


3. Clicking "Generate Pattern" renders the corresponding radiation pattern dynamically using mathematical models specific to the selected antenna.


4. Users can enable "Overlay Mode" to compare patterns or clear the canvas for a fresh visualization.


5. Patterns can be exported as an image for documentation or further analysis.

Use Cases

1. Educational Tool:

Helps students and educators understand antenna behavior and visualize theoretical concepts in practice.



2. Design and Testing:

Assists engineers in testing antenna designs and comparing different configurations.



3. Research and Development:

Useful for R&D teams exploring new antenna technologies.



4. Presentations:

Patterns can be exported and included in reports, presentations, or publications.
